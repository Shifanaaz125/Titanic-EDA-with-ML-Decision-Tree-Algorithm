# Titanic-EDA-with-ML-Decision-Tree-Algorithm

Titanic Machine Learning competition on Kaggle, this competition involves predicting whether passengers on the Titanic survived or not based on various features. Below is a summary of the key steps in the code:

1. **Import Required Libraries:** Import necessary Python libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn's RandomForestClassifier, LabelEncoder for encoding categorical data, train_test_split for data splitting, and accuracy_score for evaluation.

2. **Load the Training and Test Data:** Load the Titanic dataset for training and testing from CSV files. The training data contains information about passengers, including whether they survived, while the test data is used for making predictions.

3. **Combine Data for Encoding:** Combine both the training and test data to ensure consistent encoding of categorical variables. This is important to handle unseen labels in the test data.

4. **Data Preprocessing:** Fill missing values in the 'Age,' 'Embarked,' and 'Fare' columns with appropriate values (e.g., median or mode) to prepare the data for modeling.

5. **Encode Categorical Variables:** Use LabelEncoder to transform categorical variables like 'Sex' and 'Embarked' into numerical representations. This allows machine learning algorithms to work with the data.

**Split Data into Training and Test Sets:** Split the combined data back into training and test sets. This ensures that the model is trained on one portion of the data and tested on another.

**Select Relevant Features:** Define a list of relevant features that will be used for training and prediction. These features are selected based on their potential significance in predicting survival.

**Create and Train the Model:** Create a Random Forest Classifier, a popular machine learning algorithm, and train it using the training data. The model learns patterns in the data to make predictions.

**Select Features for Test Data:** Select the same relevant features for the test data to ensure consistency with the training data.

**Make Predictions:** Use the trained model to make predictions on the test data, which contains passenger information without survival labels.

**Create a Submission File:** Generate a submission file that includes passenger IDs and predicted survival outcomes. This file can be submitted to the Kaggle competition for evaluation.

**Evaluate Model Performance:** Calculate the accuracy of the model on a validation dataset if available. This step helps assess how well the model generalizes to new data.

### In summary, this code demonstrates the complete process of preparing, training, and testing a machine learning model for the Titanic competition on Kaggle. It ensures proper handling of missing values, categorical encoding, and feature selection. The final predictions are saved in a CSV file ready for submission, and the model's performance can be evaluated if desired.
